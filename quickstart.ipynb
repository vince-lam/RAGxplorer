    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the `RAGxplorer` package. It will help you visualize your RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) embeddings of an external document, such as a PDF, against user queries. Additionally, you will discover how to visualize outputs from various models, including the default `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model, OpenAI models, and HuggingFace models.\n",

    "2. An embedding model is selected to vectorize the text into embedding chunks\n",
